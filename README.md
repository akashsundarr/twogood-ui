# Two Good UI Clone – BRIK Community Phase 1

This project is a UI clone of the [Two Good Co.](https://www.twogood.com.au/) website. It was built as part of the **BRIK Community's Phase 1 work** to replicate a real-world website's frontend.

### 🎯 **Purpose & Learning Goals**

The primary goal of this project is to strengthen my skills in modern UI development. By manually rebuilding the frontend without using the original source code, I focused on:

* **Responsive Layouts:** Building a fluid and adaptive layout that looks great on various screen sizes, with a specific focus on a desktop resolution of **1440px x 900px**.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Structuring the UI into reusable React components for maintainability and scalability.
* **Modern Styling:** Leveraging Tailwind CSS for rapid and utility-first styling.
* **Understanding Professional Structure:** Gaining insight into how professional websites are built and organized.

### 🚀 **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend:** React (Vite)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

### 📂 **Current Sections**
